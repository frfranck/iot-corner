# sparkgw (Spark Gateway)

## Prerequisite

Before using the Spark Gateway, you need to install python packages by running:
```
sudo pip2 install -r requirements.txt
```

## wtospark.py (write to spark)

Basic Python sample code for receiving data from Arduino and writing to a spark room.

By default, it listens on 8080.

''curl -X POST -H "X-Device-Secret: 12345" http://localhost:8080/report?temp=32''

You should go to [Cisco Spark for Developers](https://developer.ciscospark.com), login, then register your first bot.
You can then create a room, either via API or via one of the spark client.
On the spark web site, if you activate the test mode, you can play with queries live.
  - YOUR_BOT_TOKEN = ""
  - YOUR_ROOM_ID =  ""

Each time you send a POST to the server, it will write "Temperature: 32" in your spark room.


## Spark and webhook

If you are running the python script locally on a laptop, the server needs to receive incoming requeston a well defined
URL.

For doing so, you can use a tunnel to your localhost with solution such as ngrok (https://ngrok.com/).

Download ngrok for your distribution, unzip it and then start ./ngrok http 8080.

The returned URL is valid as long as ngrok is running (free version). Each time you close ngrok, a new URL will be built
and you will have to renew the webhook update.


## rfwtospark.py (read from and write to spark)

Basic Python sample code for receiving data from Arduino and writing to a spark room.
But this script can also receive messages from your spark room.

You should have done the first test with wspark.py.

On the spark web site, go to https://developer.ciscospark.com/endpoint-webhooks-post.html, and create your callback.

Let's do a first callback with the following parameters:
  - name: tempwebhook
  - targetUrl: see previous section
  - resources: messages
  - event: created
  - filter: mentionedPeople=thisIsYourBotId

thisIsYourBotId should be replaced by the spark Id of your bot. This looks like a long string such as GFyazovL3VzL1BFT....GFyazovL3VzL1BFT.

In the python script, you should fill the following variables with the proper value:
  - YOUR_BOT_TOKEN = ""
  - YOUR_ROOM_ID =  ""
  - YOUR_BOT_EMAIL =  ""

Note: your bot email is mybot@spark.io if you named it mybot.

You can now send order from the spark room to your server Å“mybot TEMP?
